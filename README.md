# Coffee_Orders_Analysis
I employed Microsoft Excel to perform comprehensive data processing, analysis, and visualization on a dataset that pertained to coffee sales across four distinct types of coffee and three different countries.

Data Source:
We will be using the CoffeeOrders dataset provided by mochen862.

**Ask**
Business task:
From the given coffee sales dataset, there are several insights that can be gathered through data analysis. Here are just some potential insights that we will consider:
1. Best-Selling Coffee Type: Determine which of the four types of coffee is the best-selling overall. This can help you focus on producing or promoting the most popular coffee type.
2. Country-wise Sales or Country-Specific Preferences : This could highlight any geographic preferences or trends in coffee consumption. This can guide your marketing efforts to target specific coffee varieties to particular countries.
3. Customer Loyalty: By analyzing repeat purchase behavior, you can identify loyal customers who consistently buy your coffee. This can inform loyalty programs or targeted marketing efforts.

**Processing**
My analysis began with data preprocessing, where I cleaned and organized the raw data to ensure accuracy and consistency. I addressed missing values, corrected any anomalies, and structured the data in a way that was conducive to analysis. Date, size, unit price and sales were formatted for uniformity and checked for duplicates. I made use of the Excel functions XLOOKUP, IF, INDEX and MATCH to populate the fields customer name, email, country, loyalty card, coffee type, roast type and size of the coffee package.

**Analysis**
For the data analysis phase, I also employed pivot tables to generate insightful summaries of sales trends, helping to identify which coffee types and countries were driving the highest revenues.
1. The Excelsa was the best selling coffee type.
2. In terms of the roast, The United States prefered Medium, Ireland prefered Dark and The United Kingdom showed equal preference to Dark and Medium.
3. Four out of the top five customers do not have a loyalty card. I would recomend reaching out to these costomers and explain the possible benifits that can come with signing up.

To provide a visual representation of the findings, I employed Excel's charting capabilities. I created bar charts to compare sales across different coffee types, line charts to track sales trends over time, and pie charts to illustrate the distribution of sales among different countries that were combined into a fully dynamic dashboard.
 
**Recommendations**
With more analysis other aspects like Seasonal Trends, Price Analysis, Promotional Impact, Churn Analysis and Inventory Management can all be managed using this data. 

In conclusion, by utilizing Excel's robust features for data processing, analysis, and visualization, I was able to extract valuable insights from the coffee sales dataset. This enabled a better understanding of which coffee types were performing well in specific countries and provided actionable information for strategic decision-making in the coffee business.
